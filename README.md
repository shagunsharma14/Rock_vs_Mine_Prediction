# Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction

This repository contains the code and resources for the "Rock vs Mine Prediction" project, which aims to build a machine learning model to predict whether an underwater object is a rock or a mine based on sonar readings.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify underwater objects as rocks or mines using sonar data. Sonar technology emits sound waves and measures the echoes produced by objects in the water. By analyzing the patterns in the echo, we can determine the nature of the object.

In this project, we will utilize a dataset that consists of sonar readings collected from an experimental setup. The dataset contains a set of features extracted from the sonar readings, such as signal frequency, amplitude, and angle of incidence. Each data instance is labeled as either "R" (rock) or "M" (mine). By training a machine learning model on this dataset, we aim to create a classifier capable of accurately predicting the class of new, unseen objects.

## Usage

Open the `Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook file.

Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the following steps:

1. Data Processing: Load and preprocess the data.
2. Data Analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis and visualization.
3. Train-Test Split: Split the data into training and test sets.
4. Model Training: Train a machine learning model using the training data.
5. Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

Each step is explained in detail within the notebook.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BloodShoT14/Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to set up a virtual environment before installing the dependencies.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory. Ensure that the dataset file is named `sonar.csv`.

5. Open the `Rock_vs_Mine_Prediction.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook using Jupyter or JupyterLab and execute the cells sequentially to run the project code.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the project code:

- Python (3.7+)
- Jupyter
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

You can install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
